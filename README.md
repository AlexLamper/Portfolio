# Portfolio Map

This project is an experimental portfolio interface built with **Next.js 15** and **TypeScript**. Instead of traditional pages, the user explores a fullscreen map where projects are placed as interactive markers.

## Features

- Fullscreen SVG map rendered with **Framer Motion** animations
- Ambient background audio and subtle UI sound effects
- Project details displayed in an overlay route at `/project/[slug]`

Run the development server with:

```bash
npm run dev
```

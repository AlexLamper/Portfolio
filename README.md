# Portfolio Map

This project is an experimental portfolio interface built with **Next.js** and **TypeScript**. Instead of navigating through a set of pages, the visitor explores a fullscreen map. Projects are represented as interactive markers that open a detail overlay.

## Features

- Fullscreen SVG map rendered with **Framer Motion**
- Ambient audio managed by a simple sound controller
- Individual project markers that link to `/project/[slug]`
- Overlay component for project details

Run the development server with:

```bash
npm run dev
```
